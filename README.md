# Cube-Platformer
A basic platform game, completed on June 13, 2017.

This program was solely a side project for fun, so no full documentation will be provided.

Check out a video demo of the game here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BxGDD1Nh9j5/

The pixel art was all done by me, but it is free to use for any purpose.
